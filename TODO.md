if the current + next link is fast:
	- maintain speed

if the current link is fast, next link start to slow down:
	- if bus can pass next link before down:
	- speed up

if the current link if fast, next link is slow:
	- start coasting early
	- earlier if raining

if both links are slow
	- crawl

predict next link using past data & current conditions & AI

traffic speedband, weather, trafficincidents, inbound, outbound link data

1. data collection: traffic speedband, weather, trafficincidents (in progress)
2. training model
3. interface to output suggestion to driver
4. write tests to showcase
